GuitarAMI: Augmented Musical Instrument (AMI) using acoustic guitar

## Description

Acoustic musical instruments, although very versatile, have intrinsic sonic limitations due to their construction characteristics. For the classical nylon strings guitar, these restrictions include short sustain and the lack of sound intensity control after the attack.

The GuitarAMI uses sensors installed non-invasively in classical guitars to generate data from gestures that control algorithms to overcome these limitations, providing new possibilities of expression for the performer.
