Connect the ethernet cable to your router and turn the JackTrip box ON (connect to the power outlet).

After a few seconds, you should be automatically connected to the UdeM JackTrip server.

## Latency test

If you're required to assist in a latency test, connect an audio cable between the instrument input and the headphone jack, as shown in the picture below:

Make sure both the imput gain and the monitor volume are set to the "12 o'clock" position (check the red arrows on the image).

An operator at the JackTrip server will launch the latency test and collect the results.
